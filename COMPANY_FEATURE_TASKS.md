## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback (Single Task)
1. Identify the specific task that needs rollback
2. Use git to revert changes for that specific file
3. Test that the rollback works correctly
4. Update task status in this document

### Full Feature Rollback
1. `git checkout HEAD~1` (or appropriate commit)
2. Delete any new database fields manually
