- âœ… **Proper Relationships**: Invoices are linked to customers and users correctly

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the seed script:

```bash
npm run seed
```

### For development (keeps existing data):

```bash
npm run seed:dev
```

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure your database connection is working
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
3. Check that your MongoDB is running
4. Verify your environment variables are set correctly
